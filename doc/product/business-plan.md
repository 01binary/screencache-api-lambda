Screen Cache needs at least a short business plan explaining why users will be buying it, what need it fills within the market, what are the competitors, and the conversion funnel strategy

https://www.sba.gov/business-guide is recommended by a CEO/CTO/Principal Architect I talked to recently.



can you contact your friend who is a mobile dev and tell him to address the one issue where list scrolls to the top on item edit? I don't think I have time for something like this, and acceptance criteria for the bug fix is clear enough. He'll have to either mess a lot with that list and reverse engineer it to study all of its code, or make a list from scratch

ScreenCache

Identity
We work to enable the efficient utilization and exchange of screenshot captured information, and other image content. 

Problem
It is very time consuming, if not altogether impossible, to isolate a specific screenshot. Digging through years of screenshots/images/memes is no efficient task.

Our solution
Screencache provides intuitive and efficient screenshot/image/meme collection utilization.

Target market
Anyone with a phone and a habit of taking screenshots for later use or absorbtion.

The competition
The competition is very weak, if not entirely non-existent. Nothing that provides screenshot management is efficient or elegant, none of the tag filtering systems are adequate, and none of it provides in-the-box social component. Our first draft of the product offered improvements to all of the direct and indirect competition. Our product is built with vision and heart, where all others appear to be quickly slapped together.

Revenue streams
ScreenCache will sell a monthl/yearly premium option. Premium, in addition to increasing upload capacity and unlocking cloud storage, will allow for the creation of public-content and an ad free browsing experience, while standard will be free and allow for browsing/interacting of/with public content with minimally invasive ads placed sparingly in the public and group feeds.
This app has the potetial to employ targetted advertising technology in the same class as Facebook. Users upload all sorts of issues they're passionate about.. Facebook post screenshots, comments/arguments, recipes, articles to read later, siri song identifications, topic specific memes, doctors appointments, purchase confirmations, email reciepts.. From just these, the company can learn political affiliations, emotional triggers, music tastes, hobbies, favorite foods, purchase patterns, thought patterns, and socio-economic class and subculture can be mapped to all of these things to create demographic-archetypes with ease. When a user or the automatic text detection saves text to filter through, not only do you have an image with the metadata of when and where the screenshot was taken, and the image with secondary information(nearby ads which are themselves often target based, providing some triangulation-training and possible reverse engineering advantage), you also have the user input raw text interpretation of what was on the screen that was important enough to the user to screenshot. It's really got potential to be quite a powerful advertising tool.

Marketing activities
After a minute in the app, after X time of app use, an easily dismissable modal will inform the user of the increased functionality and how it would benefit their specific use case. In the settings area there will be a visible option to upgrade to premium. 


Expenses
It'd be nice to hire myself and Val, and an experienced react native/ mobile developer, full time to complete this unimpeded.
Operational expenses would land on a scale outlined below.

Team and key roles
CEO - Self
CTO - Val

Milestones 
as product features are added, ScreenCache will advertise in the general election as a resource for coordination and information sharing/standardization, possibly providing a "business" tier to interface directly with campaigns as opposed to just individuals working within campaigns.

And beyond
Chaos cohesion. Information detection and comparative analysis, realtime fact checking, relative suggestions. uniquely thorough and human integrated means of Artificial Intelligence training. Output of developer useful code.
